A collection of basic Python utilities for use in any Python project, in the form of
subclasses and files, and not as a third-party dependency that needs installation.

### Features:

- Logging utility
- Configuration system via PyYAML
- Commenting throughout for readable, understandable code

### Installation/Usage:

Simply clone this repository, and either start coding your project inside the Main

main.py file/program.
